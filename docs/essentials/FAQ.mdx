## Agent-Related Questions

<Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
  <AccordionItem value="file-generation">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      Allinix said it made a file / database / script, where can I find it?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Currently, Allinix cannot generate physical outputs. However, this feature is in active development. Check our [roadmap](/essentials/roadmap) for updates on this functionality.

<AccordionItem value="email-capability">
  <AccordionTrigger>Did Allinix really email 100 people?</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    Not yet! Email functionality is planned for future releases. Rest assured,
    when implemented, actions like sending emails will require explicit user
    permission. View our [roadmap](/essentials/roadmap) for development updates.
  </AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

{" "}

<AccordionItem value="loop-limits">
  <AccordionTrigger>My agent keeps running out of loops!</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    Loop limits exist due to API usage constraints and infrastructure costs. To
    work around this: - Host Allinix locally with your own API key - Upgrade to
    our pro plan for increased limits See our [setup
    documentation](/essentials/roadmap) for more details.
  </AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

{" "}

<AccordionItem value="resume-run">
  <AccordionTrigger>
    My Agent stopped unexpectedly. Can I resume from where it left off?
  </AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    Currently, each Agent run is independent and cannot be resumed. You can
    start a new run using information from the previous session. Session
    persistence is planned for future releases - check our
    [roadmap](/essentials/roadmap).

<AccordionItem value="gpt4-access">
  <AccordionTrigger>Can Allinix use GPT-4?</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    GPT-4 access varies by user type: - Free tier: Uses GPT-3.5 - PRO users:
    Have GPT-4 access - Self-hosted: Can use GPT-4 with your own API key
  </AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="output-length">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      Why does the output keep getting cut off?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Output length is limited to manage generation costs. You can increase the limit by:
      - Using your own API key and adjusting token count in advanced settings
      - Upgrading to Pro tier
      - Running Allinix locally
